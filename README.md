# Autonomous-Car
This repository hosts a self-driving car project using deep learning. It leverages a trained Keras model to predict steering angles from real-time images. The Flask app with SocketIO handles telemetry data, processes images with OpenCV, and controls vehicle speed and steering. Ideal for autonomous vehicle enthusiasts and researchers.
